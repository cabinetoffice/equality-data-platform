# Software to install

Install the following software:
* Git
  * [Git website](https://git-scm.com/)  
    Here's the page to [download Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)

  * You might also like to use a Git GUI such as [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) or [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)

* An IDE, e.g. one of:
  * [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

  * [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)

* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)  
  The latest version should be fine

* Node Package Manger (NPM) (comes with Node.js)  
  [Download Node.js & npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)  
  If you're using Windows, you probably want to download the LTS installer from that page

* The CloudFoundry CLI (v7)  
  Here are direct download links for
  [Windows](https://packages.cloudfoundry.org/stable?release=windows64&version=v7&source=github)
  and [Mac](https://packages.cloudfoundry.org/stable?release=macosx64&version=v7&source=github).  
  Here's the full [installation guide](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/wiki/V7-CLI-Installation-Guide)
  (although you probably don't need the rest of the instructions).  
  This [CloudFoundry CLI reference guide](https://cli.cloudfoundry.org/en-US/v7/) is pretty helpful
